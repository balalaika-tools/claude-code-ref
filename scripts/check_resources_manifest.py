"""Keep scripts/resources_manifest.txt in sync with resources/ and catch losses.

- Any file listed in the manifest that no longer exists under resources/ is
  reported as missing and fails the commit.
- Any file under resources/ that is not yet in the manifest is added
  automatically; the commit is then failed once so the updated manifest gets
