# Tracing an HTTP / API Service

The framework owns the request boundary. Your job is the layer underneath it: the business operations that explain why a request was slow or wrong.

The code here is **FastAPI**, which is what this skill supports. Everything
except the two framework hooks — the exception handler and the route-template
lookup — is framework-independent: span selection, route templates, outbound
calls, attributes, and streaming all apply unchanged to any ASGI or WSGI
framework whose instrumentation owns the `SERVER` span.

---

## The trace shape you are aiming for

```
POST /orders                          SERVER   (auto-instrumentation)
  validate order                      INTERNAL (manual)
  SELECT customers                    CLIENT   (auto)
  price order                         INTERNAL (manual)
    POST pricing-service /quote       CLIENT   (auto)
  send order-events                   PRODUCER (manual)
```

Auto-instrumentation gives you the first, third, and fifth lines. You write the rest.

---

## Do not create a second server span

If FastAPI instrumentation is active, it already extracts inbound trace context and starts the `SERVER` span. Do not call `propagate.extract()` in a handler and do not open another root span — you would detach the trace from its caller.

A manual span inside the handler automatically becomes a child of the server span, because the server span is current:

```python
from opentelemetry import trace

tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)


@app.post("/orders")
async def create_order(body: OrderRequest) -> OrderResponse:
    with tracer.start_as_current_span(
        "validate order", record_exception=False
    ) as span:
        span.set_attribute("app.order.line_count", len(body.lines))
        validate(body)
    ...
```

---

## Which operations deserve a span

Span an operation when its duration, failure, or decision would appear in an incident review. Concretely:

| Span it | Don't span it |
| --- | --- |
| A call to another service or provider | A getter, a mapper, a validator that never fails slowly |
| A database or vector-store query | A loop iteration |
| An expensive in-process computation (ranking, pricing, PDF render) | A logging call |
| A decision that changes the response (routing, guardrail, fallback) | A helper that only reshapes data |
| A queue publish | Reading a config value |

A useful heuristic: if the span's duration would always be under a millisecond and it cannot fail, it is an attribute on the parent, not a span.

Enrich the current span instead of creating one:

```python
def record_pricing_context(strategy: str, product_count: int) -> None:
    span = trace.get_current_span()
    if span.is_recording():
        span.set_attribute("app.pricing.strategy", strategy)
        span.set_attribute("app.pricing.product_count", product_count)
```

---

## Route templates, not paths

`http.route` must be the template — `/orders/{order_id}`, not `/orders/12345`. Framework instrumentation does this correctly for registered routes. It cannot do it for a path parsed by hand inside a catch-all handler; if the service has one, set `http.route` yourself to a bounded value.

Raw paths in span names or metric labels create one time series per ID and will take down a metrics backend.

---

## Errors

Follow `../conventions/errors.md`. For an API specifically:

- a handled 4xx is usually **not** a span error — a validation rejection is the service working correctly;
- a 5xx is;
- decide once, in writing, whether client cancellations and timeouts count as failures, because the SLO and the alert both depend on it.

The exception handler is the owning logging boundary. Emit one structured record there with `exc_info=True`, and let the inner spans carry only `error.type`.

```python
from fastapi import Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.trace import Status, StatusCode

import structlog

log = structlog.get_logger(__name__)


@app.exception_handler(Exception)
async def unhandled_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: Exception):
    span = trace.get_current_span()
    if span.is_recording():
        span.set_status(Status(StatusCode.ERROR))
        span.set_attribute("error.type", type(exc).__name__)

    log.error(
        "request_failed",
        otel_event_name="app.http.request.failed",
        exc_info=True,
        **{
            "http.route": request.scope.get("route").path
            if request.scope.get("route")
            else "unmatched",
            "http.request.method": request.method,
            "error.type": type(exc).__name__,
        },
    )
    return JSONResponse(status_code=500, content={"detail": "internal error"})
```

---

## Outbound calls

Use the instrumented HTTP client and let it inject trace context. Do **not** call `propagate.inject()` for a request that HTTPX or `requests` instrumentation already handles — you would set the headers twice, and the second write may not be the one you expect.

Create the client after the instrumentor is installed. `../setup/sdk_bootstrap.md` covers the ordering and the lifespan pattern that guarantees it.

Manual injection is correct only for a transport no instrumentation owns — see `queue_messaging.md`.

---

## Attributes worth setting on the request

Set these at span creation where possible, so a sampler can use them:

| Attribute | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `http.route`, `http.request.method`, `http.response.status_code` | auto-instrumentation |
| `app.tenant.tier` — one key, everywhere (`../conventions/naming.md`) | authenticated identity |
| `app.workflow.name` | which product flow this endpoint serves |
| `user.id`, `session.id` | authenticated identity, if privacy policy allows — traces only, never metrics |
| `gen_ai.conversation.id` | GenAI services, see `genai/attributes.md` |

Derive them from the authenticated request, never from unvalidated request body fields. A caller-supplied "tenant tier" is a spoofable metric dimension.

---

## Streaming responses

A streaming endpoint (SSE, chunked JSON) has two latencies that matter: time to first byte, and total duration. The server span's duration covers the whole stream. Record first-chunk latency explicitly:

```python
span.set_attribute("app.response.time_to_first_chunk", first_chunk_at - started)
```

`app.response.time_to_first_chunk` is the API's own first byte and belongs to the server span. It is **not** the model's first chunk, and on a GenAI endpoint it is not the agent's either — three different numbers, tabulated in `genai/attributes.md`. Confusing them hides where the latency actually is.

Make sure the span ends when the stream ends, including on client disconnect. A generator that is never fully consumed can leave a span open until the process exits.

---

## Then

- metrics: `../metrics/service.md` — request duration, active requests, dependency latency, business counters;
- logs: `../logging/structlog.md` — `request_received` / `request_completed` with trace correlation;
- if the endpoint publishes to a queue: `async_handoffs.md` and
  `queue_messaging.md` for the producer side;
- if the endpoint calls a model: `genai/attributes.md` for the span vocabulary.
