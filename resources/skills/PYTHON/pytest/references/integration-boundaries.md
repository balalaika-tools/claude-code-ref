# Framework-neutral integration boundaries

Use this reference for a Python backend that reaches databases, filesystems,
processes, or remote services without a more specific FastAPI, worker, or
LangGraph reference, and for cross-cutting suite selection or CI design.

## Keep profiles complementary

Use cheap deterministic tests where behavior can be isolated, real integration
tests for production boundaries whose semantics the application relies on, and
a small number of broad tests for wiring and critical journeys. This is a risk
portfolio, not a required ratio.

- Push exhaustive decision tables down to pure or application tests.
- Test adapter request construction and error translation with a transport or
  SDK fake, then use a smaller real-infrastructure test for encoding, lifecycle,
  configuration wiring, and compatibility.
- Keep E2E scenarios outcome-focused. If an E2E failure exposes a branch not
  covered below, add the narrow regression and retain the E2E case only when it
  still proves distinct wiring.
- Do not call a test unit merely because it uses mocks or integration merely
  because it imports a framework. Classify executed dependencies.

## Databases

- Use an explicitly test-scoped disposable database and make destructive setup
  refuse ordinary production or developer service URLs.
- Test repositories, constraints, migrations, transaction isolation, locking,
  and dialect-specific SQL on the production database family.
- Apply real migrations to an empty database. `metadata.create_all()` cannot
  prove the migration chain.
- A connection plus outer transaction/savepoint can make same-connection tests
  fast, but it does not isolate a worker, process, or second connection. It can
  also hide commit visibility and locking defects.
- Use committed setup plus a unique database, schema, tenant, or explicit reset
  for multi-connection, worker, outbox, and concurrency tests.
- Re-read final state through a fresh session when identity-map caching could
  satisfy the assertion.
- Use one SQLAlchemy `Session` per thread and one `AsyncSession` per async task.

SQLite is valid evidence when production is SQLite or the test deliberately
proves dialect-independent application behavior. It is not evidence for
PostgreSQL transactions, constraints, locking, types, or migrations.

## HTTP and external services

At an owned adapter boundary, cover only the request and response behavior the
application relies on:

- method, URL, selected headers, auth, timeout, encoding, and correlation or
  idempotency key;
- schema-tolerant parsing and application-owned error translation;
- retry classification for timeout, cancellation, selected 4xx/5xx responses,
  and malformed payloads;
- absence of accidental public network in the default suite.

A transport fake or disposable local protocol endpoint is usually more stable
than patching client-library internals. Add an opt-in provider contract or live
smoke only for compatibility a local substitute cannot prove. Bound calls,
time, cost, and data; redact recordings. A cassette proves the recorded response,
not the provider's current behavior.

For independently deployed services, consumer-driven contracts can complement
provider integration. Include only fields the consumer depends on and verify the
contract against the provider; do not turn a full payload snapshot into a false
compatibility guarantee.

## Filesystems, subprocesses, and CLIs

- Use `tmp_path` or another isolated disposable root and assert externally
  observable files, permissions, exit codes, stdout/stderr contracts, and
  cleanup.
- Do not patch file I/O when atomic rename, locking, path encoding, permissions,
  or crash recovery is the behavior under test.
- Bound subprocess execution, capture output, and terminate descendants during
  teardown. Avoid relying on the developer's current working directory, shell
  aliases, or global environment.
- Contract-test installed entry points and package resources through the same
  installation shape used in CI or deployment.

## Markers, skips, xfails, warnings, and CI

These are review and design criteria. Do not modify pytest configuration or CI
unless the user's requested scope includes those files; otherwise report the
specific change required.

- Register custom markers and enable the strict validation supported by the
  locked pytest version.
- Mark by execution cost or prerequisite (`integration`, `e2e`, `live`,
  `slow`), not by business package.
- A selected infrastructure job must fail when its prerequisite is absent.
  Silent all-skipped success is a broken job.
- `skip` means the test cannot apply in the selected environment. `xfail` means
  a precise known defect or dependency limitation; include a reason or issue,
  narrow condition and failure type, and strict XPASS behavior.
- Assert intentional warnings with `pytest.warns`. Do not hide project or
  dependency deprecations behind broad filters.
- Keep a direct reproducible command for each profile. Preserve counts and
  useful artifacts such as service logs, request/correlation IDs, and minimized
  Hypothesis examples.
- Favor deterministic tests and proportionate disposable integration in PR
  feedback. Put destructive recovery, broad process topology, long property
  profiles, and live-provider checks in explicit jobs.

Do not require parallel CI for a serial project. Tests should still avoid order
dependence and uncontrolled global state; add xdist-specific resource isolation
when parallel execution is used or planned.
