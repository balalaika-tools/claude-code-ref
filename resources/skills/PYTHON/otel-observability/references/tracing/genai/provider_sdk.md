# Direct Provider SDK Instrumentation

For services that call OpenAI, Anthropic, Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, or Google GenAI/Vertex directly, without an agent framework. This is usually the simpler case: standalone model calls rather than an agent loop.

Three neighbours own what this file uses: `attributes.md` (the constants module), `token_usage.md` (`set_usage_attributes` and the per-provider adapters), and `content_capture.md` (the `CAPTURE_AI_CONTENT` switch). Read `attributes.md` first.

## Contents

- [Provider wrapper](#one-wrapper-per-provider-not-a-span-at-every-call-site)
- [Usage adapters](#usage)
- [Streaming](#streaming)
- [Retries](#application-level-retries)
- [Embeddings and retrieval](#embeddings-and-retrieval) — moved to `retrieval.md`
- [Checklist](#checklist)

The provider wrappers are **partial integration templates** because the SDK
client and response adapter are service dependencies. Before copying one, add
the exact adapter from `token_usage.md`; the streaming fragment additionally
requires local `extract_stream_usage()` and `extract_text_delta()` helpers for
the locked provider SDK. Do not treat an undefined helper as pseudocode that is
safe to deploy.

## One wrapper per provider, not a span at every call site

Put the span, the attribute mapping, and the provider-specific response parsing in one function. Everything else in the service calls that function.

Why: response shapes differ per provider and change between SDK versions. If forty call sites each read `response.usage.prompt_tokens`, an SDK upgrade is a forty-site migration and the attributes drift apart in the meantime.

Span kind is `CLIENT` for a remote provider and `INTERNAL` for an in-process model.

The span covers **one logical operation**. If the SDK retries internally, the span covers all of it — that is what the caller experienced. Retries the *application* performs are separate spans; see below.

---

## Usage

`extract_usage()` above is intentionally not defined in this fragment. It is the provider adapter that converts this SDK's response shape into the normalized usage dict, which `set_usage_attributes()` then writes. Copy the complete adapter for the locked SDK from **`token_usage.md`**, keep it next to this wrapper in code, and add an import/compile smoke test so a renamed SDK field fails in CI rather than production.

For Bedrock specifically: read usage from the `bedrock-runtime` response body, and note that `opentelemetry-instrumentation-botocore` is deliberately **not** installed (see `../../setup/auto_instrumentation.md`) — it would trace every low-level AWS call. Instrument the model call by hand as above.

---

## Streaming

Two different latencies matter: time to the first chunk (what the user perceives) and total duration (the span). Record both.

**Never hold `start_as_current_span` across a `yield`.** A Python generator does
not get its own `contextvars` context: `start_as_current_span` calls
`context.attach()`, and when the generator yields, that attach is still in
effect *in the consumer*. Use `start_span` and end the span in `finally`.

```python
def stream_chat(client, messages: list[dict], *, model: str):
    # start_span, not start_as_current_span — see the note below the fence.
    # The parent is whatever span is current at the FIRST iteration, because a
    # generator body does not run until then.
    span = tracer.start_span(
        f"chat {model}",
        kind=SpanKind.CLIENT,
        attributes={
            GENAI_OPERATION_NAME: "chat",
            GENAI_PROVIDER_NAME: "openai",
            GENAI_REQUEST_MODEL: model,

        },

    chunk_count = 0

        [] if settings.capture_ai_content else None
    )

    try:
        # Only the non-yielding work is made current, so any span the SDK or a
        # retry hook creates still nests under the model span.

        )

        span.end()
```

### Why the span is never current across a `yield`

PEP 550 was rejected, so generators and async generators share the caller's
`contextvars` context. `start_as_current_span` attaches on entry and detaches on
exit; between them the generator yields control **with the attach still live**,
which produces three silent defects:

- a span the consumer creates between two chunks becomes a child of the *model*
  span instead of the request span — the same "siblings where you expected
  nesting" symptom this skill elsewhere attributes to *lost* context, so the
  diagnostic points the wrong way;
- two interleaved streams unwind their `detach()` tokens out of order and the
  SDK logs `Failed to detach context`;
- concurrent streaming requests in one task can inherit each other's parent.

`start_span` + explicit `end()` avoids all three. When a child genuinely must
nest under the model span, wrap only that work in
`trace.use_span(span, end_on_exit=False, record_exception=False)` and make sure
no `yield` sits inside it. The same rule applies to the agent-level wrappers in
`langchain/streaming_and_agent_span.md`.

### Helpers this fragment expects

Three provider-specific helpers must be defined or imported in the final
module. Their contracts, so the gap is a fill-in rather than a design task:

| Helper | Signature | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `extract_usage(response)` | `(Any) -> dict` | the normalized usage dict for a non-streaming response — adapter in `token_usage.md` |
| `extract_stream_usage(chunk)` | `(Any) -> dict` | the same normalized dict, read from the provider's usage-carrying chunk |
| `extract_text_delta(chunk)` | `(Any) -> str \| None` | the incremental text of this chunk; `None` for a usage-only, role-only, or tool-call-only chunk |

The constants and metric recorders it uses are imported in the first fragment.

`stream_options={"include_usage": True}` is not optional — without it the provider sends no token counts at all and the omission is silent. Why, and the equivalent for other providers: `token_usage.md`.

The failure mode specific to streaming *generators* is that **the span never ends**. If the consumer abandons the generator, the `finally` runs only when the generator is closed or garbage-collected. Wrap the caller so the generator is always exhausted or explicitly closed, and confirm on a client-disconnect test that the span ends.

Never create a span per token or per chunk. One span per inference call. Thousands of spans per request overwhelm the Collector and make the trace unreadable.

---

## Application-level retries

If the application retries around the SDK, each attempt should be its own span so you can see that three attempts happened rather than one slow call.

```python
for attempt in range(1, max_attempts + 1):
    try:
        return complete_chat(client, messages, model=model)   # own span per attempt
    except RateLimitError:
        if attempt == max_attempts:
            raise
        time.sleep(backoff(attempt))
```

Put the attempt number on the span if the wrapper accepts it (`app.gen_ai.request.attempt`), and wrap the whole retry loop in a parent span when the caller needs the total latency in one place.

Retry only transient failures — timeouts, connection errors, rate limits, 5xx. A malformed request retried three times is three identical failures and three times the cost.

---

## Embeddings and retrieval

RAG spans live in **`retrieval.md`**, because they are identical on both paths —
a LangChain service needs them too, and should not have to load this
direct-SDK file to get them.

---

## Checklist

- [ ] One wrapper per provider owns the span and the response parsing.
- [ ] `gen_ai.operation.name`, `gen_ai.provider.name`, `gen_ai.request.model` set at span creation.
- [ ] Response model, response ID, and finish reasons recorded.
- [ ] Response model is also passed to `record_model_operation`; request and response model remain separate.
- [ ] Usage adapted from the provider's shape and passed through `set_usage_attributes()` — `token_usage.md`.
- [ ] Streaming calls request usage explicitly and record `gen_ai.response.time_to_first_chunk`.
- [ ] Streaming chunk count is correct with capture off; captured content is bounded and exists only with capture on.
- [ ] Content capture gated on `CAPTURE_AI_CONTENT`, off by default — `content_capture.md`.
- [ ] `error.type` on failure, no `record_exception`, per `../../conventions/errors.md`.
- [ ] Duration and token metrics recorded on both success and failure paths — `../../metrics/genai.md`.
- [ ] Streaming wrappers use `start_span` + `finally: span.end()`; no span is current across a `yield`.
- [ ] Embeddings and retrieval are their own spans — `retrieval.md`.
