# Logging Implementation

Adapt these rules to the repository's language and logging library. In Python, prefer the existing `structlog` or stdlib `logging` setup; do not introduce `structlog` solely to rename a working structured logger.

## One central pipeline

The shared logging owner must apply, in a deterministic order:

1. level/severity normalization;
2. UTC timestamp;
3. static service identity;
4. request/job/workflow context;
5. active trace correlation when available;
6. exception normalization and detail policy;
7. recursive secret and policy redaction;
8. JSON serialization and delivery.

Enrichment and redaction must run before rendering. Configure the pipeline once at process startup, before application modules emit records. Do not let a library call `basicConfig`, replace root handlers, or own shutdown behind the application's back.

Use one-line JSON in deployed environments. Keep keys and value types stable. Timestamp values use ISO 8601 UTC or the platform's documented canonical format. Configure log level through the existing typed settings object rather than scattered environment reads.

## Canonical envelope

A normal record should resemble:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-08-10T09:12:44.113Z",
  "level": "info",
  "event": "workflow_transition_completed",
  "service.name": "order-worker",
  "workflow_run_id": "wf-123",
  "workflow_state": "capture_payment",
  "attempt": 2,
  "duration_s": 0.482,
  "outcome": "success"
}
```

Use native JSON numbers and booleans, not strings. Avoid null-filled universal schemas; omit fields that do not apply unless downstream schema requirements say otherwise.

## Context lifecycle

Bind execution context at the real boundary and clear it in `finally`:

- HTTP middleware: request ID, route and permitted tenant context;
- queue consumer: message/job ID, queue, attempt and workflow ID;
- scheduled job: job type and run ID;
- workflow transition: run ID, state and attempt.

Context-local storage must be safe for the runtime's concurrency model. Test concurrent requests or jobs to prove fields do not leak. A long-running worker must clear context between units of work.

Accept incoming correlation IDs only after validating length and character set. Generate one at the boundary when absent if the application needs request correlation. Do not reuse a producer's request ID as the current job ID; carry both under distinct names when both matter.

## Optional trace correlation

If the application already has OpenTelemetry or another tracing system, add its valid active IDs in the central enricher:

```text
trace_id  32 lowercase hexadecimal characters
span_id   16 lowercase hexadecimal characters
```

Omit them when no valid context exists. Do not add OpenTelemetry packages, exporters, OTLP configuration, or a Collector merely to satisfy logging. Do not emit an upstream or linked trace ID as the current `trace_id`; if a demonstrated search need exists, use a distinct `causal_trace_id`.

Trace sampling does not sample logs. A log can correctly reference a trace absent from the trace backend. Design log volume independently.

## Libraries and third-party logs

Route application and library records through one final schema when practical. Preserve the original logger name under `logger` or `logger.name`. Apply explicit level overrides only to known noisy namespaces. Do not discard warnings/errors from an entire dependency namespace to silence one noisy event.

Access logs may remain under the framework's owner. Ensure they are structured and correlated when operators depend on them, but do not create a second routine request-completion event with the same purpose.

## Startup and shutdown

Configuration-validation failures that occur before logging initializes go to stderr without secrets. Buffering or asynchronous handlers must flush within the runtime's shutdown budget. CLIs, batch jobs, workers, pre-fork servers, and serverless runtimes require explicit lifecycle verification; a successful function return does not prove the final record was delivered.
