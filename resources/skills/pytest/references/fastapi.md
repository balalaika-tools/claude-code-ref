# FastAPI and backend boundaries

Use this reference for FastAPI, Starlette, ASGI lifecycle, async API tests, and
database-backed request paths. Inspect the installed FastAPI, Starlette, client,
AnyIO or pytest-asyncio, SQLAlchemy, and Alembic versions before adapting an
example; these APIs and defaults evolve together.

## Split the proof by responsibility

Do not make every behavior an HTTP test. Use complementary boundaries:

| Responsibility | Faithful test |
| --- | --- |
| Domain and application decisions | Call the action directly with explicit fakes |
| Request parsing, dependency wiring, auth policy, status, response schema, exception mapping | In-process ASGI request with outer effects replaced |
| App construction, startup failure, shared resource creation and disposal | App-factory/lifespan test |
| Repository queries, constraints, transactions, migrations | Production-dialect disposable database integration |
| HTTP plus database transaction/outbox behavior | API integration with a bound real session/database |
| Reverse proxy, deployed middleware, process configuration, multiple real boundaries | Small E2E or deployed smoke suite |

Keep exhaustive business branch tables below the HTTP layer. API tests prove
transport-owned behavior and a few representative vertical flows.

## Construct an isolated application

- Prefer an application factory that accepts settings or a runtime/composition
  object. Tests should create an app with explicit test configuration rather
  than importing a module-global app that connected to services at import time.
- Put loop-bound pools, clients, models, and workers in lifespan. Importing a
  router or pure application action must not require credentials or open a
  connection.
- Use one app per test when its state or overrides mutate. A wider app fixture is
  acceptable only when all per-test mutation is restored and lifecycle
  semantics are intentional.
- Test startup validation and cleanup separately from route behavior. Force
  resource-construction failure and verify later resources are not leaked.

### Dependency overrides

FastAPI overrides are keyed by the exact original dependency callable and
replace its subdependency tree. They are global mutable application state.

- Override an owned outer dependency, such as an application action, current
  principal, or session provider. Do not patch FastAPI's dependency resolver.
- Keep a separate test for the real dependency. A route suite with fake auth or
  database access does not prove those integrations.
- Install overrides before entering lifespan if startup uses them.
- Restore the exact previous mapping in `finally`, even if app startup or the
  test fails. Clearing the dictionary can destroy unrelated pre-existing
  overrides in shared setups.
- Do not use one enormous dependency override that bypasses application-owned
  authorization, validation, and transaction behavior being tested.

## Synchronous request tests

Use a normal `def` test and `TestClient` when the test does not need to await
resources on the test's event loop.

- Enter `TestClient(app)` as a context manager whenever lifespan matters. Plain
  construction does not prove startup and shutdown behavior.
- Keep `raise_server_exceptions=True` by default so unexpected application bugs
  fail at their origin. Set it to false only in the focused test of the rendered
  500 response or error middleware.
- Test through public paths and real request serialization. Calling route
  functions directly bypasses validation, dependencies, middleware, exception
  mapping, and response-model filtering.
- Context-manage WebSocket sessions and assert closure or protocol errors as
  well as messages.

Starlette's synchronous client runs the ASGI app in its own thread/event loop.
Do not use it when the test must also await or inspect an async database client,
pool, lock, or other loop-bound object created by the test.

## Asynchronous request tests

Make the whole test async when it needs app-adjacent async resources.

- Follow the repository's chosen plugin and marker (`pytest.mark.anyio` or
  pytest-asyncio), not both auto modes.
- Use the compatible ASGI transport/client for the installed FastAPI and
  Starlette versions and give the client a test base URL.
- HTTPX `ASGITransport` does not start lifespan. Wrap the app in a compatible
  lifespan manager and pass its state-aware app to the transport when lifespan
  state is used.
- Create the app's async clients and pools inside lifespan or async fixtures on
  the same loop that serves requests.
- Bound every async wait and clean up spawned tasks before fixture teardown.

AnyIO's default test backend behavior may exercise more than asyncio. If the
application intentionally supports only asyncio, configure that explicitly. If
multiple backends are supported, treat the matrix as a deliberate contract.
Align higher-scope async fixtures with the backend/event-loop scope supported by
the installed plugin; old recipes that replace a global `event_loop` fixture may
no longer be valid.

## High-value HTTP behaviors

Select cases owned by the transport or visible at the service boundary:

- required, omitted, malformed, and meaningful boundary inputs;
- authentication versus authorization and tenant/resource isolation;
- not found, conflict, precondition, rate-limit, and idempotency semantics;
- application error to stable status/body/header mapping;
- response-model filtering so private fields do not leak;
- media type, cookies, caching, pagination, location, retry, and correlation
  headers when clients rely on them;
- transaction outcome and durable side effects, including outbox or scheduled
  work after the response;
- cancellation, timeout, disconnect, and cleanup when the API promises behavior
  for them;
- OpenAPI or schema compatibility only for the externally consumed subset.

Do not retest every Pydantic rule or FastAPI default. One representative 422
request can prove the boundary wiring; test application-owned validation and
error shape where it differs from framework defaults.

Avoid full response snapshots unless the entire document is a versioned public
contract. Prefer semantic JSON assertions and separate schema/contract tests for
large documents.

## Background tasks and work submission

An in-process API test can prove that the endpoint schedules or publishes the
right work after the right preconditions. It cannot prove a separate worker
discovers, deserializes, retries, or acknowledges that work.

- Test the background callable or application action directly for its branch
  matrix.
- At the HTTP boundary, assert the accepted response and the stable task/event
  envelope or outbox record.
- Verify publication timing relative to commit and rollback. A worker must not
  race an uncommitted row.
- Add worker/broker integration in the worker suite for delivery semantics.

For Starlette/FastAPI in-process background tasks, use a focused test only when
that mechanism is the production mechanism. Do not mistake same-process
completion under a test client for durable queue behavior.

## Streaming and WebSockets

Test the protocol consumed by the client, not incidental chunk boundaries.

- Assert status, media type, stable event/message schema, ordering guarantees,
  terminal signal, and error representation.
- Reconstruct semantic content across chunks. Network, model, and framework
  buffering can change chunk sizes without changing behavior.
- Test disconnect/cancellation and prove generators, sessions, locks, and other
  lifespan resources are released.
- For dependencies that `yield`, assert the intended cleanup point relative to
  stream completion. FastAPI's dependency-scope and streaming cleanup semantics
  have changed across releases, so lock versions and test the behavior relied
  on by the service.
- For WebSockets, cover handshake/auth rejection, message schema, normal close,
  and abnormal disconnect only when the application owns those policies.

## Database-backed tests

### Match production semantics

- Use the production database family for repository, constraint, transaction,
  migration, locking, and concurrency tests. SQLite is not a PostgreSQL or MySQL
  compatibility layer.
- Start from an explicitly disposable target and guard destructive setup against
  ordinary service credentials or non-test database names.
- Apply actual Alembic migrations to an empty database in CI. Also check that
  the current database is at all configured heads and that model changes do not
  require an uncommitted migration.
- Test downgrade only when operational rollback is supported; do not add a
  ceremonial downgrade test for a one-way migration policy.

### Transaction isolation fixture

For same-connection SQLAlchemy tests, the SQLAlchemy 2.x external-transaction
recipe can bind a session with `join_transaction_mode="create_savepoint"` to a
connection inside an outer transaction. Application code may commit or roll
back its session, while teardown rolls back the outer transaction.

This is not a universal isolation mechanism:

- another connection, process, or worker cannot see uncommitted fixture data;
- commits made on another connection are outside the outer rollback;
- rollback-only tests can hide commit visibility, locking, and race defects;
- sharing a session across threads or an `AsyncSession` across tasks is unsafe.

Use committed setup and a unique database/schema/tenant or explicit reset for
multi-connection, worker, concurrency, and outbox tests. Stop dependent workers
before cleanup. Re-query final state through a fresh session where caching could
mask reality.

### Minimum database confidence

Cover only the semantics the application relies on:

- mapped types and serialization;
- unique, foreign-key, check, and exclusion constraints;
- representative queries, ordering, pagination, and null behavior;
- commit, rollback, and no partial state after failure;
- optimistic or pessimistic locking and important race outcomes;
- idempotency/deduplication under separate concurrent connections;
- migration from blank to head and from each operationally supported prior
  release snapshot;
- application transaction plus outbox/enqueue timing.
