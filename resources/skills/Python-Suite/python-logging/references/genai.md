# GenAI Logging

Apply this on top of the normal event, implementation, and security rules.

## Content stays out of logs

Never log prompts, system instructions, completions, tool arguments/results, retrieved documents, embedding inputs, or raw provider requests/responses. A tracing or evaluation system's content-capture switch does not authorize the log backend, whose retention and access controls differ.

Bounded metadata is acceptable when useful: provider, requested/response model, normalized tool or agent name, attempt, token counts, duration, finish reason, outcome, and permitted conversation/session identifiers. User-provided tool names must be normalized or kept out of grouping fields.

## Default decisions

| Situation | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Successful model call | No routine log; latency, usage, and success belong in existing telemetry or aggregate reporting |
| Terminal model failure owned at provider boundary | One `model_request_failed` error |
| Model failure escaping to HTTP/job/agent owner | Log only the outer boundary failure |
| Recovered provider/tool retry | One warning per failed physical attempt, with attempt and `outcome=retried` |
| Provider/model fallback | `model_fallback_activated` warning |
| Guardrail block | `guardrail_blocked` |
| Agent step limit | `agent_step_limit_reached` |
| Cancellation | `agent_invocation_cancelled` |
| Empty retrieval | `retrieval_empty` |
| Summarization/compaction | `summarization_triggered` |
| Successful agent/retrieval completion | Only when audit or business search needs it independently |

Do not create success logs for every model, tool, and agent layer. One failed user operation must not produce duplicate stack traces from provider, retry middleware, tool, agent, and HTTP handler.

## Suggested fields

Use standard semantic field names already established by the project where possible, for example `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.response.model`, `gen_ai.provider.name`, `gen_ai.tool.name`, and `gen_ai.agent.name`. Add bounded `attempt`, `error.type`, and `outcome`.

Conversation, session, and user identifiers are high-cardinality and privacy-sensitive. They may appear only for an approved search purpose. They never justify logging content.
