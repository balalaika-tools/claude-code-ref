# FastAPI Startup and Shutdown

Read this file only for FastAPI. Read `startup_prefork.md` as well when
Gunicorn or another pre-fork server owns the worker processes.

```python
# app.py
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

import httpx
from fastapi import FastAPI
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.fastapi import FastAPIInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.httpx import HTTPXClientInstrumentor

from observability.logging import configure_logging
from observability.tracing import configure_observability, shutdown_observability

# 1. Providers exist before any instrumented work happens. The same owner
# shuts down traces, metrics, and optional OTel logs.
providers = configure_observability()
configure_logging(providers.logger_provider)

# 2. Process-wide hooks, before any client is constructed.
HTTPXClientInstrumentor().instrument()


@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    # 3. Constructed after HTTPX instrumentation is active.
    app.state.pricing_client = httpx.AsyncClient(
        base_url="http://pricing-service:8080", timeout=5.0
    )
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        # 4. Close clients while telemetry is still running.
        await app.state.pricing_client.aclose()
        # 5. Flush last.
        shutdown_observability()


app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)
FastAPIInstrumentor.instrument_app(app)
```

Never call `FastAPIInstrumentor.instrument_app(app)` inside the lifespan.
Lifespan runs after the server has built the middleware stack; the call fails
or silently does nothing.
