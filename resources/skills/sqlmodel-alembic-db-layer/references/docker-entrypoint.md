# Dockerfile Entrypoint: Monorepo vs. Single-Service

Follows the multi-stage shape from `python-uv-workspace-monorepo`'s
`references/docker-builds.md` (uv stage → python-base → builder → runtime,
`.venv` copied into runtime, non-root numeric user, `tini` as the process
entrypoint). This file only covers the one piece that's specific to running
migrations: what the runtime stage's `ENTRYPOINT`/`CMD` should be, and how
that differs between the two repo shapes in `references/repo-layout.md`.

The two cases end up structurally different for the same reason the folder
layout does: in a monorepo, `db-migrate` is a dedicated image that does
*nothing but* run migrations, so running migrations is its default behavior.
In a single-service repo there's only one image total, so migrations are a
one-off *override* of that image's normal command, never the default.

## Monorepo — `services/db-migrate/Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
# ... same uv / python-base / builder stages as any other workspace member ...
# builder: uv sync --locked --no-dev --no-editable --package db-migrate

FROM python-base AS runtime
COPY --from=builder /app/.venv /app/.venv
COPY services/db-migrate/alembic.ini services/db-migrate/alembic.ini
COPY services/db-migrate/alembic services/db-migrate/alembic
WORKDIR /app/services/db-migrate
USER 10001:10001
ENTRYPOINT ["tini", "--"]
CMD ["/app/.venv/bin/alembic", "upgrade", "head"]
```

- `alembic.ini` and `alembic/` are `COPY`'d explicitly, not baked into the
  wheel — per `docker-builds.md`: *"Copy migrations or external configuration
  separately only when they intentionally remain outside the installed
  package."* Migrations are exactly that case.
- `WORKDIR` is set to wherever `alembic.ini` was copied to, so the bare
  `alembic upgrade head` finds it without a `-c` flag.
- The alembic invocation is the container's `CMD`, not baked into
  `ENTRYPOINT` — `tini` stays the entrypoint (correct signal handling for a
  short-lived task), and only the `CMD` array is what a one-off run
  overrides. That's what makes `alembic downgrade -1` or `alembic history`
  for debugging a plain command-array override at the orchestration layer,
  never a rebuild.
- No other service (`api`, `worker`, …) ever copies `alembic.ini` or installs
  `alembic` — this image is the only place that dependency exists at all
  (`references/repo-layout.md`).

## Single-service repo — root `Dockerfile`

One image total. Its default `CMD` runs the application; migrations are an
override of that same image, never a separate build:

```dockerfile
FROM python-base AS runtime
COPY --from=builder /app/.venv /app/.venv
COPY src src
COPY alembic.ini alembic.ini
WORKDIR /app
USER 10001:10001
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["tini", "--"]
CMD ["/app/.venv/bin/uvicorn", "myservice.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8080"]
```

Running migrations means overriding just the command, same image, same
`ENTRYPOINT`:

```bash
/app/.venv/bin/alembic upgrade head
```

`WORKDIR` is already `/app`, and `alembic.ini` was copied to `/app/alembic.ini`
— alembic finds it in the current directory with no `-c` flag needed, exactly
like the monorepo case, just at a different path.

## The difference, side by side

| | Monorepo (`db-migrate`) | Single-service |
|---|---|---|
| How many images | A dedicated one, only for migrations | One, shared with the app |
| Default `CMD` | `alembic upgrade head` | the app server |
| How a migration run happens | The default — no override needed | `CMD` override at task-run time |
| Who has `alembic` installed | Only `db-migrate` | The one and only service (unavoidable — there's nothing else to keep it out of) |

In both cases `ENTRYPOINT` stays `["tini", "--"]` — what changes is only ever
the `CMD` array, whether that's the image's baked-in default (monorepo) or an
explicit override at run time (single-service).
