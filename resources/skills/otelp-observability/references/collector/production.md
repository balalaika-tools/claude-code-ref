# Production Collector Configuration

**Do not open this file unless a production Collector config is being
written or changed.** Read `../tracing/production_policy.md` first — it owns
the retention decisions this file implements, and implementing them without
the measurements it requires produces a config with unjustified numbers in it.

Production has a different job from staging: keep what explains failures, drop what costs money and teaches nothing, and never leak content into a backend that should not hold it.

## What a production tracing strategy preserves

```
all errors           → 100%
slow traces          → 100%
important traces     → 100%   (critical routes, high cost, guardrail blocks,
                                release burn-in, selected tenants)
normal successes     → a percentage
```

Retaining every trace forever is not a strategy — it is a bill. Retaining a flat 5% is not either: it drops most of your errors.

The exact rates depend on traffic volume, cost, latency thresholds, and operational requirements. Do not copy a percentage from this file without checking it against actual volume.

**Metrics are not sampled this way.** They keep aggregating and exporting at full fidelity, because error rates and SLO burn cannot be computed from a sample.

---

## Head sampling versus tail sampling

| | Decides | Can it keep all errors? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Head (SDK) | at trace start | No — the error has not happened yet |
| Tail (Collector) | after the trace is assembled | Yes |

Use tail sampling for the policies above. Head sampling is only for crude volume reduction when even receiving every trace is too expensive; if you use it, use a parent-aware ratio sampler so whole traces are kept together.

---

## Remove deterministic noise before sampling

Read `../tracing/production_policy.md` first; it owns the decision between
source exclusion, span filtering, trace-aware sampling, and probabilistic
sampling. Prefer source exclusion for proven-useless work because it saves SDK,
network, and Collector cost. It also hides every status for that URL and may
suppress HTTP metrics, so verify both effects before enabling it.

Use the Collector filter only for a verified leaf or self-contained server span.
A span whose condition evaluates true is **dropped**.

The pinned Collector accepts two spellings, and **the path prefix rule differs
between them** — which is the actual trap here, because mixing them fails only
at startup:

| Key | Paths must be | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `trace_conditions` | fully prefixed: `span.attributes[...]` | context-inference form; unprefixed `attributes[...]` is rejected |
| `traces: { span: [...] }` | either `span.attributes[...]` or bare `attributes[...]` | the long-standing per-signal, per-context form |

Do not reach for `trace_statements`: that is the *transform* processor's key and
it modifies telemetry rather than dropping it.

```yaml
processors:
  filter/successful_probes:
    error_mode: ignore
    trace_conditions:
      - >
        resource.attributes["service.name"] == "my-api" and
        IsMatch(span.attributes["http.route"],
                "^/(health|healthz|live|ready|metrics)$") and
        span.attributes["http.response.status_code"] == 200
```

Replace the service and routes with observed values. Keep the status predicate:
the rule above deliberately preserves failed probes. Never use only a global
span-name match. The filter removes individual matching spans, so dropping a
parent with instrumented children creates orphaned telemetry. If the endpoint
does real child work, retain or tail-sample the whole trace instead.

When enabled, insert this processor after resource enrichment and before
redaction/tail sampling. Validate the exact config against the pinned image —
`../../scripts/validate_skill.py --collector-image` now does this for **every**
YAML fence on this page, wrapping partial snippets in a minimal config so a
processor's schema is checked rather than assumed.

## Configuration

**Every value marked `# MEASURE:` below is a placeholder that happens to be
syntactically valid so the file can be image-validated. None of them is a
default.** Replace each one with the measurement named on its line before this
config reaches production; the inputs are collected in
`../tracing/production_policy.md`, "Required measurements". A config still
carrying the numbers below has not been sized — it has been pasted.

| Knob | Derive from |
| --- | --- |
| `decision_wait` | measured p99 complete-trace arrival + export/network jitter |
| `num_traces`, `expected_new_traces_per_sec` | measured new traces/second × `decision_wait` × burst headroom |
| `decision_cache` sizes | active capacity × late-span headroom, biased to the more common outcome |
| `latency.threshold_ms` | the service's own "slow" definition, above normal p95 |
| `numeric_attribute.min_value` | the token count that actually marks an expensive call here |
| `sampling_percentage` | measured volume, backend budget, and minimum useful daily samples |
| `memory_limiter.limit_mib` | the container memory limit, minus headroom |

```

The default metrics path is OTLP/HTTP. Use a backend-specific push exporter
only when the selected backend requires it; do not introduce a pull reader or
receiver as an intermediate transport.

### Processor order is not cosmetic

```
memory_limiter        first — self-protection before anything else
resource enrichment   before any rule that reads resource attributes
deterministic filter  optional; only for verified leaf/self-contained spans
redaction             before data crosses a trust boundary
tail_sampling         after the attributes its policies read exist
batch                 last, so exporters send efficient payloads
```

Redaction is also **per signal**: `attributes/drop_secrets` belongs on every
pipeline, `attributes/drop_span_exception_detail` on traces only, and
`attributes/drop_payloads` on the APM trace path only. A processor written for
spans and reused on logs is how a stack trace disappears from the one place the
error contract puts it.

Redaction after fan-out is redaction that already leaked. Tail sampling before enrichment cannot see the attributes it filters on.

Add a processor only with a stated purpose. Each one costs CPU and a place where telemetry can be silently altered.

---

## Adding a Langfuse path

Two pipelines consume one application trace: APM keeps the complete tree without GenAI payloads; Langfuse keeps approved payloads and the rooted projection from `genai_projection.md`. The application still owns one provider and root; neither branch rewrites identity.

```yaml
processors:
  filter/langfuse_projection:
    error_mode: ignore
    trace_conditions:
      # DROP unmarked spans; the application marks GenAI spans and their complete path to the root.
      - 'span.attributes["app.telemetry.category"] != "genai"'

  transform/langfuse:
    error_mode: ignore
    trace_statements:
      - >
        set(span.attributes["langfuse.trace.name"],
            span.attributes["app.workflow.name"])
        where span.attributes["app.workflow.name"] != nil
      - >
        set(span.attributes["langfuse.release"],
            resource.attributes["service.version"])
        where resource.attributes["service.version"] != nil
      - >
        set(span.attributes["langfuse.trace.metadata.tenant_tier"],
            span.attributes["app.tenant.tier"])
        where span.attributes["app.tenant.tier"] != nil

exporters:
  otlphttp/langfuse:
    endpoint: ${env:LANGFUSE_OTEL_ENDPOINT}
    headers:
      Authorization: "Basic ${env:LANGFUSE_AUTH_STRING}"
      x-langfuse-ingestion-version: "4"
    sending_queue:
      enabled: true
      queue_size: 10000
      storage: file_storage
    retry_on_failure:
      enabled: true

service:
  pipelines:
    traces/apm:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors:
        - memory_limiter
        - resource/environment
        - attributes/drop_secrets
        - attributes/drop_span_exception_detail
        - attributes/drop_payloads     # APM does not get payloads
        - tail_sampling
        - batch
      exporters: [otlphttp/apm]

    traces/langfuse:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors:
        - memory_limiter
        - resource/environment
        - attributes/drop_secrets      # secrets still go
        - attributes/drop_span_exception_detail
        - tail_sampling
        # Sample the complete trace before projecting; operational errors affect retention.
        - filter/langfuse_projection
        - transform/langfuse           # payloads stay on this branch
        - batch
      exporters: [otlphttp/langfuse]
```

Every retained span needs a retained path to the root; the processor does not infer ancestors. Mark the root, GenAI spans, and real business ancestors with `app.telemetry.category="genai"`, not operational siblings. Never filter on `gen_ai.*` alone. If no meaningful business wrapper exists, parent the workflow directly under the operation root. The full invariant is in `genai_projection.md`.

Both branches share a trace ID and preserve retained span/parent IDs. A log's trace ID finds the operation in both backends; a projected-out span has no Langfuse observation-level counterpart.

**Naming `tail_sampling` in two pipelines allocates it twice.** This example has two buffers and decision-cache pairs. Budget `N ×` the single-instance estimate (`--sampling-pipelines N`), or sample once and fan out through a routing/forward connector. Identical probabilistic policies agree because both hash the same trace ID with the same default salt.

The mapping **copies** rather than renaming canonical `gen_ai.*`. Neutral `app.gen_ai.observation.*` values are deleted after the Langfuse copies are made, as shown in `component.md`; APM contains neither payload representation.

Only map what a concrete Langfuse filter needs. Mirroring every application attribute into `langfuse.trace.metadata.*` produces an unusable filter list.

`LANGFUSE_AUTH_STRING` is base64 of `public_key:secret_key` — not a third credential:

```bash
LANGFUSE_AUTH_STRING="$(printf '%s' "${LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY}:${LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY}" | base64 | tr -d '\n')"
```

The trailing-newline strip matters; `base64` adds one and the header then fails authentication with an unhelpful 401.

---

## Redaction is a second line of defence, not the first

An `attributes` processor deletes **by key**. It cannot find a secret embedded inside an otherwise-permitted JSON string — an API key inside `gen_ai.input.messages`, an email inside a tool result.

Mask or allowlist content in the **application**, before it becomes a span attribute. Then use these rules to catch what the application missed.

Delete `user.email` by default. The Collector attributes processor's `hash`
action is unsalted SHA-1: it can obscure some high-entropy values, but it does
not anonymize a guessable email address and still creates a stable
cross-event identifier. If stable pseudonyms are a real business requirement,
create them before telemetry emission with a keyed HMAC, controlled key
rotation, documented retention, and privacy review.

Test it with canary values: put a fake API key, a fake email, and a fake authorization header through the pipeline and grep both backends' payloads for them. Do this whenever a new instrumentation library is added, because each one brings its own attribute keys.

---

## Tail sampling at scale

All spans of a trace must reach the same instance, or the sampler decides on a fragment and silently exports an incomplete trace.

```
services → trace-ID-aware load balancer → tail-sampling tier → backends
```

Standard round-robin breaks this. Use the `loadbalancing` exporter with `routing_key: traceID` in a front tier, or the Operator's equivalent.

Also watch: `decision_wait` must exceed p99 complete-trace arrival plus
SDK/export/network jitter. A 30-second agent trace under a 10-second
`decision_wait` gets decided on partial data.

Estimate a starting active buffer as:

```text
num_traces >= new_traces_per_second * decision_wait_seconds * burst_headroom
```

Use `../../scripts/estimate_trace_budget.py` to calculate a reproducible lower
bound, and pass `--sampling-pipelines N` when `tail_sampling` is named in more
than one pipeline. Serialized trace size is not Collector heap size, so
load-test and tune against real memory. Configure decision caches much larger
than `num_traces` when late spans are possible, and bias them toward the more
common sampled or non-sampled outcome.

Monitor traces dropped before decision, late spans, policy evaluation errors,
decision latency, memory-limiter activity, and the actual effective retained
ratio. Important policies overlap; configured percentages cannot be added to
predict the result.

### Temporary high-value policies

Add service-specific policies only after the matching bounded attributes have
been verified in exported spans:

```yaml
- name: keep-critical-routes
  type: string_attribute
  string_attribute:
    key: http.route
    values: ["/checkout", "/payments/{payment_id}"]

- name: keep-release-burn-in
  type: string_attribute
  string_attribute:
    key: service.version
    values: ["<immutable-new-release-git-sha>"]
```

Record an owner and expiry for release burn-in, then remove it automatically or
as a required rollout step. A force-sampling policy additionally requires an
authenticated internal producer, allowlisted attribute, audit record, and TTL;
never map a public request header or caller-supplied baggage directly to it.

---

## Resilience

| Setting | Prevents |
| --- | --- |
| `memory_limiter` first, below the container limit | OOM-kill instead of graceful shedding |
| `sending_queue` with `file_storage` | Losing buffered telemetry on restart |
| `retry_on_failure` with a bounded `max_elapsed_time` | Retrying forever into a dead backend |
| `batch` last | Inefficient per-span exports |

Size the queue from measured batch size and the outage you are willing to buffer through. A bigger queue costs memory and does not repair a slow backend. A persistent queue is a write-ahead log, not a durable message bus — it still loses data if the disk fills or the retry window expires.

Telemetry loss is preferable to application downtime. Silent telemetry loss during an incident is the worst of both, so alert on the Collector's own metrics (`component.md`).

---

## Deploy carefully

- Validate every config change in CI against the exact production image.
- Record the policy owner, rationale, thresholds, expected volume, review date, and expiry of temporary rules.
- Roll config changes gradually and keep a tested rollback path. A bad telemetry config creates blind spots precisely when you need visibility.
- Canary one bounded operation before rollout. Confirm that the APM backend has the complete tree
  without GenAI payloads and that Langfuse has the same trace ID as a connected root/business/GenAI
  projection with the expected captured-content mappings.
- Compare application request/job metrics with Collector accepted/exported counts and backend ingest; process health alone does not prove delivery.
- Watch trace completeness, orphan rate, late spans, early decisions, error-trace retention, memory, queue utilisation, and actual retained percentage during the canary.
- Remove release burn-in and forced-diagnostic rules when their expiry is reached.
- Keep environment credentials separate.

## Before calling it done

- [ ] `otelcol validate` passes against the production image.
- [ ] No `# MEASURE:` value from this file survives unreplaced.
- [ ] `memory_limiter` is first, and its limit is below the container memory limit.
- [ ] No metrics pipeline contains a sampling processor.
- [ ] Errors and slow traces are kept at 100%; the sampled percentage is justified by measured volume.
- [ ] `decision_wait` exceeds measured **p99 complete-trace arrival plus jitter**, not merely p99 trace duration.
- [ ] `num_traces` and decision caches survive measured bursts and late spans, multiplied by the number of pipelines that name `tail_sampling`.
- [ ] `deployment.environment.name` uses `action: insert`, so a service that sets its own environment is not relabelled.
- [ ] `exception.stacktrace` is deleted on traces only; a canary exception's stack trace still arrives in the log backend.
- [ ] Trace-ID-aware routing exists in front of any scaled tail-sampling tier.
- [ ] Successful-noise handling preserves failed probes and does not orphan instrumented children.
- [ ] Canary secrets do not reach any backend.
- [ ] Email and other low-entropy personal fields are deleted, not presented as anonymized hashes.
- [ ] Credentials come from a secret store and appear in no committed file.
- [ ] Receivers are bound to private networks.
- [ ] Collector self-metrics are pushed over OTLP to an independent monitoring path, and structured internal logs leave via an independent platform log agent or direct endpoint.
- [ ] Any periodic self-metrics reader has an explicit, measured reader-level timeout comfortably below the platform termination grace period, and a hanging-destination shutdown test proves application queues still drain.
- [ ] Collector self-telemetry has stable role/environment identity, preserves
      the per-replica `service.instance.id`, and alerts use rates/increases for
      counters rather than historical values.
- [ ] Health probes, self-telemetry, and an end-to-end backend canary are all present; none is treated as proof supplied by another.
- [ ] Temporary burn-in/diagnostic rules have an owner and expiry.
- [ ] Langfuse exporters use OTLP/HTTP and send `x-langfuse-ingestion-version: "4"`.
- [ ] The main trace backend contains the complete operational tree with every verbose GenAI payload and neutral presentation copy removed.
- [ ] Langfuse contains the same trace ID, the root, GenAI spans, and only their meaningful business ancestors; every retained parent exists and retained span IDs match the main trace.
- [ ] Tail sampling evaluates the complete trace before the Langfuse projection filter.
